# citygamesystems

-----------
Staging ground for the exploration and development
of systems useful for infrastructure simulation toys
and games, with a focus on the city simulator genre.

**Status**: There are the beginnings of a small debugging
library called `Visualization` and a noise based, clickable test map
that allows for the placement of markers. There are also
a few lines of yet to be tested node graph code (the transport
network kind, not the Blender kind xD).
There's also `Cavedig`, because I needed something to debug
the debugging. <.<"
